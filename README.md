Representation of the [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) v3 specification.
AsyncAPI is a standard inspired by OpenAPI/Swagger targetting asynchronous
and event-driven APIs.

This project aims to allow users to parse AsyncAPI specifications into Rust
objects as well as creating and serializing AsyncAPI specifications.
